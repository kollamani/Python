# 1. __name__ is a special variable.
# 2. If we want to know whether the program executed as a normal individual program or as a module then we use __name__ variable.
# 3. If you will execute a python individual program then it will give you the output as __main__.
# 4. If you will execute the program as a module from some other program then the value of __name__ variable is name of the module.
