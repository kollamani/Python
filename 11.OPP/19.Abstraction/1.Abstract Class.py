##### Abstract Class and Abstract Method #####
'''
--->Partial Implementation of a class is called as abstract class.
--->Partial implementation means not complete implementation.
--->Abstract class is the blueprint for other classes.
--->Abstract class contain at least one abstract method.
--->Python doesn't provide support for abstract class, so we have to import a module named as abc module.
--->abc module stands for abstract base class.
--->Abstract class can also contain concreate method.
--->Abstract method means a method without having body part is called abstract method.
--->If we don't know the body part of a method then at that particular time we can define abstract method.
--->By using @abstractmethod decorator we can abstract method.
--->Child class will provide the body part of abstract method.
--->We can create the object of a abstract class. 
--->If a method have body part then that method is called as concreate method.

'''
The abc module and ABC class are part of Python's standard library and are used to define Abstract Base Classes (ABCs). This provides a way to define abstract classes in Python, similar to other object-oriented languages.

The abc Module:
The abc module in Python provides tools for defining abstract base classes (ABCs). An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and usually contains abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass.

The ABC Class:
The ABC class is the base class for defining abstract base classes in Python. It provides the necessary functionality to define abstract methods and mark a class as abstract. It is defined within the abc module.

Key Components:
Abstract Methods: You can define abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator. These methods must be implemented by any subclass.
ABC Class: You subclass ABC to create your own abstract base class.

#Example of Using abc Module and ABC Class:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod #Here abc module ABC class

# Define an abstract base class
# Animal class is child class of ABC
class Animal(ABC):
    # Abstract method (must be implemented by subclasses)
    #Method not having any implementation(no body part)
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass
    # Concrete method (can be inherited as-is)
    def sleep(self):
        print("This animal is sleeping.")

# Define a Child class that inherits from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    # Implement the abstract method
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof! Woof!")

# Create instances
# animal = Animal()  # This will raise an error because Animal is abstract
dog = Dog()
dog.sound()  # Outputs: Woof! Woof!
dog.sleep()  # Outputs: This animal is sleeping.

   
'''Example of Using abc Module and ABC Class:'''
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass
    
    def sleep(self):
        print("This animal is sleeping.")

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof! Woof!")
        
# animal = Animal()  # This will raise an error because Animal is abstract
dog = Dog()
dog.sound()
dog.sleep() 

#Use of Abstract Class:
'''An abstract class is used to define a blueprint for other classes. It provides a common structure with methods that must be implemented in the child classes. If we dont know the complete implementation while creating class then we go for abstract class'''
#Example:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class Vehicle
class Vehicle(ABC):

    # Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses
    @abstractmethod
    def Color(self):
        pass

    # Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses
    @abstractmethod
    def Model(self):
        pass

# Concrete subclass for Vehicle
class car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, company):
        self.company = company

    def Color(self,colr):
        print(f"My car Company is {self.company} and the color is {colr}")

    def Model(self,mdl):
        print(f"My {self.company} car belongs to {mdl}")
        
#We can create n no of concrete subclasses for Vehicle like above

# Instantiate objects
c = car("Suzuki")
c.Color("Red")
c.Model(2020)
