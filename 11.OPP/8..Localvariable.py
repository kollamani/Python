    def add(self):
        a=10  #local variable
        b=20  #local variable
        result=a+b
        print(result)
c1=Calculator()
c1.add()

#Example
class calculator:

        print(result)
        
    def sub(self):
        print(a)  #Here var a and b not works because they are local to add method
        print(b)
