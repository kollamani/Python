# a=10.7 #here we cannot delare data type because python is dynamically typed
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
# print(id(a))

# a="Rama krishna"
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
# print(id(a))

# x = 8 # int
# y = 2.8  # float

# z = 1j   # complex
# # To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
# # Example
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# x = 1 # int
# y = 2.8 # float
# z = 1+10j # complex 1 real part and 10 is imaginary part
# #convert from int to float:
# a = float(x)
# #convert from float to int:
# b = int(y)
# #convert from int to complex:
# c = complex(x)
# print(z.real)
# print(z.imag)
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))


# # SOME IMP INBUILT FUNCTIONS Before concept :

# # Random Number
# '''Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:'''

# # Example
# import random
# print(random.randrange(1,10))

# #input function
# a=input("Enter the input:")
# print(a)

# #If suppose if we give specific data type it will take that type of data only as input.
# a=int(input("Enter the input:"))
# print(a)

# print(type(a))

# #But the input() default type is string.

# # Types to print the output

# # 1.Print with the print function
# X=10
# print(X)

# # 2.Print with string formatting %
# name="Rama Krishna"
# age=29
# print("My name is %s and my age is %d"%(name,age))

# # 3.Print with the str.format() method
# age=29
# print("My name is {} and my age is {}".format(name,age))

# name1="Gopal"
# print("My name is {name} and my age is {age}".format(name=name1,age=age))

# course="Python"
# price=2.99 #print this is dollar format
# print("My course is {} and the price is ${price:.1f}".format(course,price=price))

# # 4.Print with the ‘f-string’ 
# name="Rama Krishna"
# print(f"my name is {name}")

# salary=10000
# tax=0.2
# print(f"my monthly salary is ${salary-tax}")

# # 5.Print to a file or a stream
# #printing to a file
# with open('result.txt','w') as f:
#     print("This will retun to a file", file=f)

# #printing to a stream  
# import sys
# print("This will return to a stream", file=sys.stderr)
