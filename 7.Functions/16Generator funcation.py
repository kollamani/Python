# #Generator function:
# '''A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does go with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.'''
# '''The difference between the yield and the return statement in Python is:
# Return: A function that returns a value at once. The return statement returns a value and exits the function altogether.
# Yield: A function that yields values repeatedly. The yield statement pauses the execution of a function and returns a value.
# When called again, the function continues execution from the previous yield. A function that yields values is known as a generator.'''

# #Example:
# # A Python program to demonstrate use of generator object with next() 

# # A generator function 
# def simpleGeneratorFun(): 
# 	yield 1
# 	yield 2
# 	yield 3

# # x is a generator object 
# x = simpleGeneratorFun() 

# # Iterating over the generator object using next 

# # In Python 3, __next__() 
# print(x.__next__())
# print(next(x)) 
# print(next(x))

# #Example:
# def simpleGeneratorFun(): 
# 	yield 1			
# 	yield 2			
# 	yield 3			

# # Driver code to check above generator function 
# for i in simpleGeneratorFun(): 
# 	print(i)
 
# #Example:
# def simpleGeneratorFun(): 
#     n=1
#     while n<=10:
#         sq=n*n
#         yield sq
#         n=n+1

# # Driver code to check above generator function 
# for i in simpleGeneratorFun(): 
# 	print(i)
