######## Process #######
'''
--->Program in execution is called as process.
--->When we are starting any application in our system at time, operating system will create process.
--->A process is an independent program with in its own memory space.
--->Ex: A person Notepad, MS word, browser then os will create 3 different process.
'''
######## Thread ########
'''
--->Thread is a smallest unit of a process or program.
--->A thread is an independent part with in a process.
--->A thread is a smaller unit of a process and shares the same memory space with other threads with in the process.
'''
###### Multitasking ######
'''
--->Doing multiple tasks in simultaneously called multitasking.
--->Generally multitasking are of 2 types.
    =>Thread based multitasking(Multiple tasks will execute with in a process, and each tasks are independent.)
    =>Process based multitasking(Multiple tasks will execute simultaneously, here each task are independent process.).
'''

###### Multithreading ########
'''
--->Multithreading is a technique, by using this technique we will break down a large task into multiple sub-tasks and execute these tasks simultaneously.
--->If we will use multithreading in our programming, then we will get better performance.
'''

##### Main Thread ####
'''
--->Whenever we are executing our python program then immediately PVM will send request OS to create one thread and that is MainThread.
--->By default, each python program will be executed by MainThread.
--->Each python program contain at least one thread that is MainThread.
If we want to work with thread in python, then we must import one inbuild module that is "threading".
